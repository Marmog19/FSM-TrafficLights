# FSM-TrafficLights
This is a Finite State Machine for two sets of stoplights, used to control the traffic flow in an intersection between a road that goes North and a road that goes East.

Made using 6 LEDs (2 green, 2 yellow and 2 red) as the lights and a button as input to know which road has more traffic. Implemented in an STM32 board. Prototyped using a Breadboard.
